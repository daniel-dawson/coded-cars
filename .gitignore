# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep
/yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log*
.byebug_history

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more
/config/master.key

# Webpack and yarn
/public/packs
/public/packs-test
/node_modules
.yarn-integrity

# dotenv
.env

# Mac files
.DS_Store
