# Full Stack Engineer Exercise

## Overview

We’re designing a simple application to track cars and car owners for our administrators. As a full stack engineer, we’d like you to build a small Ruby on Rails application. Outside of Rails, you can any tools or libraries of your choice.

Feel free to ask as many or as few questions about the requirements as you feel are necessary.

## Basic Requirements

Your application must have endpoints for:

- **Person maintenance.** The creation, updating, deletion, and display of one or more People. People should have the basic attributes of: name, email, and a contact telephone number.
- **Car maintenance.** The creation, updating, deletion, and display of one or more Cars.  Cars should have the basic attributes of: model, make, color, mileage, owner and a boolean flag of is_for_sale.
- **Ownership history.** Cars and Owners have a history of ownership. The ownership history should be visible on both the Person and Car detail page.

## Bonus Points

- Implement an automated tests using tools of your choice.
- Database makes use of indexes and foreign keys.
- Database is seeded with sample data.
- Implement basic authentication.
- Implement table-based sorting of the cars display page and/or the ownership page.
