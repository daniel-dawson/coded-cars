# Questions

- "Ownership History" implies that the cars can be bought and sold by the owners. Should I show that in this app? If so, what info should be included? (Listing price, date bought/sold, etc.)
- Is this app more car-focused or person-focused? (Owner is an attribute on the car model.)
  - Do the cars hold the history or the people?
- Is the ownership history tracking a specific car-person relationship or following each car and person separately over their lives?

## Answers

Hi Meg,

Great questions, answers below:

> Is this app supposed to be more car-focused or owner-focused?

Neither, this is an admin tool for quickly editing these items.  This is a back of house tool which will not be seen by customers.  It should be neat and clean, but don't spend a lot of time on fancy UX.

> Should I be adding this function into the app as well and, if so, are there any requirements for how to do this?

Good question!  No need to add any functionality here, this is display only.  You should add some data here manually or through seeds for your demo though.

> Lastly, is this due back at any certain time? Or should I just have it ready when I come in on Wednesday?

Just be ready by Wednesday.   A couple of suggestions: I'd push everything up on to GitHub so we can review the code and commit history. Focus more on the quality of the work, rather than total completeness of the app. 

Thanks!

Joe
