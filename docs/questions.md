# Questions

- "Ownership History" implies that the cars can be bought and sold by the owners. Should I show that in this app? If so, what info should be included? (Listing price, date bought/sold, etc.)
- Is this app more car-focused or person-focused? (Owner is an attribute on the car model.)
  - To the cars hold the history or the people?
- Is the ownership history tracking a specific car-person relationship or following each car and person separately over their lives?
